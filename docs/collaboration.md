## Accessing the Repository

To access the Git repository, including large assets stored with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) follow these steps:

**1. Install Git LFS**

```
git lfs install
```

**2. Clone the Repository**


Once you have Git LFS installed, open your terminal or command prompt and use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Helbling-Technik/HelMoRo.git
```

**3. Pull Files with LFS**


After successfully cloning the repository, navigate to the local repository directory using the following command:

```
cd HelMoRo
git lfs pull
```


Once the `git lfs pull` command completes, you will have all the large files available in your local repository, and you can work with them as needed.
