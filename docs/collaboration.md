# Collaboration

This guide provides instructions for general collaboration across the entire project, as well as specific setup and contribution details for those working on the project documentation.

## General Collaboration Guidelines

The HelMoRo project welcomes contributions in various forms: bug fixes, feature additions, and documentation improvements. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute across any part of the project.

### 1. Report or Identify Issues

Start by identifying or reporting issues. Describe the problem or suggest enhancements comprehensively.

- **Repository issues page:** [HelMoRo issues](https://github.com/orgs/Helbling-Technik/projects/1/views/1)
- **Feature Bucket:** Select from existing tasks on our GitHub projects page: [Feature Bucket](https://github.com/orgs/Helbling-Technik/projects/1)

### 2. Clone the Repository

For direct contributions, clone the repository using SSH (recommended):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Helbling-Technik/HelMoRo.git
```

If you prefer you can also fork it and then work on your own fork.
### 3. Create a Branch

Create a new branch in your cloned repository for the specific issue you are addressing:

```bash
git checkout -b issue-number-description
```

### 4. Make Changes

Implement your fixes or enhancements within your branch. Keep your branch updated to avoid conflicts:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master
```

### 5. Commit and Push Changes

Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Detailed description of your changes"
git push origin issue-number-description
```

### 6. Submit a Pull Request

After pushing your changes, submit a pull request (PR) through GitHub, linking it back to the issue it resolves.

### 7. Participate in the Review Process

Engage with the project maintainers during the PR review process and address any feedback  to facilitate the integration of your contributions.

### 8. Stay Involved

Continue contributing by addressing more issues, reviewing others' contributions, and participating in project discussions.
