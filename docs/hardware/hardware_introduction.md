# Hardware

We tried to design HelMoRo in such a way that he can be easily sourced and assembled by anyone.   

This section contains the documentation for the hardware of HelMoRo. All parts of HelMoRo can be bought on the Internet, 3D-printed or bought from a supplier for metal sheets.
The list of parts can be found in chapter #Bill-of-materials, with a suggested online source. 

Once you have sourced every part, you can start the mechanical and electronical assembly process as described in chapter #assembly-instrcutions.
