# Welcome to Helmoro

Welcome to the official documentation of **Helmoro**, the **Hel**bling **mo**bile **ro**bot. Helmoro is an open-source robotic platform designed by Helbling Technik in Zurich, Switzerland. 

It is equipped with LiDAR sensors and depth cameras, and thus is able to navigate autonomously. Additionally, we implemented a ROS node that allows the robot to be controlled with a game controller.

On this website, you will find a comprehensive guide designed to help you build your own mobile robot. 

Whether you are looking to get started with our software, interested in the technicalities of our hardware designs, or seeking detailed installation guides, you've come to the right place.

The website is structured into [Hardware Documentation](hardware/bill_of_materials.md) and [Software Documentation](software/01_software_introduction.md). 

In the Hardware section, you will find a complete list of materials, access to all CAD files, as well as the complete assembly instructions. 

In the Software section, you'll find a link to the repo containing all the source code as well as a complete guide on how to install and run all the packages. Additionally, we tried to explain the thoughts behind some of the algorithms.
