Helmoro is equipped with state-of-the-art components that enable it to perform a wide range of tasks. An overview over all components can be found in the [Bill of Materials](hardware/bill_of_materials.md). Let's take a closer look at its key features:

### Robust Construction

Helmoro boasts a sturdy and reliable four-wheeled chassis, providing stability and durability in various environments. Its skid-steered navigation system ensures agile movement and precise control.

### Motor Control

Four DC motors, each with an angular encoder, power Helmoro's locomotion. The robot is equipped with two [Roboclaw Motor Controllers](https://www.basicmicro.com/Roboclaw-2x7A-Motor-Controller_p_55.html), allowing for accurate and efficient motion control.

### LIDAR Sensor

Helmoro utilizes a high-performance [Slamtec RPlidar](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A2/) LIDAR, enabling it to perceive its surroundings with exceptional accuracy. This LIDAR sensor facilitates mapping, navigation, and obstacle avoidance capabilities.

### RGB-D Camera

The [Orbbec Astra Pro](https://orbbec3d.com/product-astra-pro/) RGB-D camera integrated into Helmoro provides detailed depth perception and color information. This camera enhances the robot's visual perception, enabling advanced computer vision tasks.

### IMU Sensor

To maintain orientation and detect changes in motion, Helmoro is equipped with the [Adafruit BNO055 Absolut Orientation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor) Sensor. This Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) enhances the robot's stability and navigation capabilities.

### Computing Power

Helmoro is powered by the [NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit) running Ubuntu 18.04. This compact yet powerful computing platform enables efficient data processing and supports various machine learning algorithms.
