## Key Features

### Robust Construction

HelMoRo is built on a robust and reliable four-wheel chassis that provides stability and durability in a variety of environments. Its skid-steered navigation system ensures agile movement and precise control.

### Motor Control

Four DC motors, each with an angular encoder, power HelMoRo's locomotion. The robot is equipped with two [Roboclaw Motor Controllers](https://www.basicmicro.com/Roboclaw-2x7A-Motor-Controller_p_55.html), which enable accurate and efficient motion control.

### LIDAR Sensor

HelMoRo utilizes a high-performance [Slamtec RPlidar LIDAR](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A2/), enabling it to perceive its surroundings with high accuracy. This LIDAR sensor facilitates mapping, navigation, and obstacle avoidance capabilities.

### RGB-D Camera

The [Orbbec Astra Pro RGB-D Camera](https://orbbec3d.com/product-astra-pro/) integrated into HelMoRo provides detailed depth perception and color information. This camera enhances the robot's visual perception, enabling advanced computer vision tasks.

### IMU Sensor

To maintain orientation and detect changes in motion, HelMoRo is equipped with the [Adafruit BNO055 Absolut Orientation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bno055-absolute-orientation-sensor) Sensor. This Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) enhances the robot's stability and navigation capabilities.

### Computing Power

HelMoRo is powered by the [NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit) running Ubuntu 18.04. This compact yet powerful computing platform enables efficient data processing and supports various machine learning algorithms.

## Capabilities

### Video, Map, and Position Streaming

 HelMoRo can stream real-time video, map, and position information to a local computer, allowing for remote monitoring and analysis.

### Remote Joystick Control

With its remote joystick control functionality, HelMoRo can be operated and maneuvered easily from a distance.

### Autonomous Navigation

HelMoRo can autonomously navigate to set goal positions, utilizing its LIDAR sensor, camera, and IMU for obstacle avoidance and path planning.

### Object Detection and Autonomous Pickup 

The robot can detect objects and perform autonomous pickup tasks.

### Remote-Controlled Mapping:

HelMoRo can be remotely controlled to perform mapping tasks, allowing for the creation of detailed maps of its environment.

### Autonomous Mapping

Using its LIDAR sensor and mapping algorithms, HelMoRo can autonomously explore and map unknown environments.

### Finger Gesture Commands

Under development is the ability for HelMoRo to interpret finger gestures as commands for autonomous pickup tasks, adding a touch of interactivity to its functionality.
